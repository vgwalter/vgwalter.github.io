<p>*“If you work hard enough and assert yourself, and use your mind and imagination, you can shape the world to your desires.” – Malcolm Gladwell*</p>

<p>Hi! I’m Victoria G. Walter and I’m 22 living in the New York metro area. When I’m not on my computer learning to program or reading the New Yorker or the Wall Street Journal, you’ll most likely find me watching Bon Appétit recipes and trying them out in the kitchen. </p>
<p>I recently graduated magna cum laude from Dickinson College with a bachelor’s of arts in economics and political science. Following unexpected challenges in my senior year, I decided to turn the months following graduation into an opportunity to learn and grow, not only my skillset but also myself. Since then I’ve refocused on my goals and values, made significant positive lifestyle changes and started on a path of well-rounded self-improvement.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m seeking an analyst position in consulting or financial services in the New York City or Boston metro areas. In addition to my interest in business, I love cooking, baking, and everything about the arts. Take a look below— you’ll see what I’m currently learning, fun facts about me, and some of my favorite things.
Finally, if you’d like to connect or have any questions, my email, LinkedIn, resume, and other information are available on my home page. Thanks for stopping by!
