I graduated magna cum laude from Dickinson College in 2019 in economics and political science. I am currently seeking an entry-level analyst position in financial services or capital markets, with a particular interest in ESG and impact investing.

In Summer 2018 I interned for Chatham Financial in their private equity real estate fund, Union Square Capital Partners, where my primary responsibilities included providing due diligence on leads for the Head of Sales and Distribution. Together, with Chatham's Chief Marketing Officer, we created a successful promotional campaign to hundreds of registered investment advisors (RIA).

At Chatham Financial and my economics and accounting courses, I cultivated my quantitative abilities including proficiency in Microsoft Excel and VBA, financial modeling, Stata, R, and most recently have taught myself Python. I am also proficient in statistics, calculus I, and calculus II. Additionally, I sharpened my data analysis capabilities through two econometric analyzes (see papers below).

These opportunities were a great compliment to my liberal arts education I received at Dickinson, which focused on advancing my reading, writing, and critical thinking abilities. My courses in political science were concentrated in policy analysis, recent global geopolitics, and U.S. Constitutional Law, and further advanced my capabilities in reading critically and writing analytically. At Dickinson, I also held several leadership positions including four years as the Financial Director for WDCV 88.3 FM "The Voice of Dickinson College," one year as the Chairwoman of Media Board, where I developed and managed a budget of $75,000 annually, and a founding member of the Dickinson College Cheerleading Team.

Through previous internships and jobs, I have been exposed to business development, sales, and marketing. In Spring 2018 I interned at Becky's Bites, a food-based start-up, where I created marketing campaigns and marketing collateral including newsletters and blog posts for corporate clients. I cultivated my sales skills as a sales representative for CollegeTown Promos, a personalized merchandise start-up, where I cold-called businesses and organizations throughout my community and sold over $10,000 in personalized merchandise.
